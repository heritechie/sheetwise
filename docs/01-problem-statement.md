# Problem Statement

Organizations today rarely suffer from a lack of data.

Instead, they struggle with **using data consistently**.

---

## The Shape Problem

Operational data is often:

- nested
- event-based
- optimized for application logic
- inconsistent across teams

While this data is technically available, its structure is not suitable for direct analysis.

As a result, each analysis effort begins by reshaping the data again and again.

---

## The Repetition Problem

Common symptoms include:

- the same dataset being recreated multiple times
- different teams producing different numbers
- analytics discussions focusing on data correctness
  instead of insights

This repetition erodes trust in data and slows down decision-making.

---

## The Tooling Gap

Existing tools tend to focus on extremes:

- **ETL and data engineering tools**
  focus on pipelines and infrastructure

- **BI tools**
  focus on visualization and interpretation

What is often missing is a lightweight layer that focuses purely on **analytics readiness**.

## Why Spreadsheets Still Matter

Despite modern tooling, spreadsheets remain the most common medium for understanding data.

This is not a failure of technology, but an indication that:

- humans need flat, explicit representations
- ambiguity in data shape leads to confusion
- clarity precedes insight

---

## The Cost of Ambiguity

When data shape is unclear:

- numbers are questioned
- decisions are delayed
- trust is lost

The cost is not technical. It is organizational.

---

## The Opportunity

There is an opportunity to introduce a system that focuses solely on preparing data into a clear, deterministic, and reusable form.

A system that stops before interpretation, but ensures that interpretation can happen on solid ground.

That system is the problem space Sheetwise addresses.
