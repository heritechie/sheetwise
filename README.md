# Sheetwise

Sheetwise is an analytics readiness layer that prepares operational data
into deterministic, BI-ready datasets.

Sheetwise helps users define _what_ they want to analyze — time, metrics,
and dimensions — and produces flat, human-consumable tables ready for BI tools.

## What Sheetwise Does

- Transforms messy operational data into flat, BI-ready datasets
- Uses guided chat (via Slack or Web) to define analytics intent
- Produces deterministic outputs that can be trusted and reused

## What Sheetwise Does NOT Do

- It does not generate insights or conclusions
- It does not replace BI tools
- It does not act as a data warehouse or ETL platform
- It does not perform automated decision-making

## Product Philosophy

Sheetwise focuses on _readiness_, not interpretation.

> Chat is used to define intent.  
> The web is used to preview and trust the result.

## Status

This repository currently contains **design specifications and system architecture**.
Implementation will follow after the core concepts are fully validated.
